# Dynamic-Starbucks-Website
Dynamic web development project in which we used the Bootstrap framework to design the client-side web pages of Starbucks website, interacted with Databases using PHP, and dynamically retrieve the data from the servers. We learned how to integrate data from an existing data source (e.g. an RDBMS) into an existing static website.  

### How to setup the database
- Open phpMyAdmin by visiting http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
- Click the import button in the navbar
- In the 'File to import' section choose the 'webassignment.sql' file
- Click the Import button at the button of the page
